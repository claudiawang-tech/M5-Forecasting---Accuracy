# M5 Forecasting-Accuracy
Estimate the unit sales of Walmart retail goods

## About this project

This project is a code competition held by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy) and the University of Nicosia. It is a time series project, aimming to use hierarchical 
sales data from Walmart to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. It challenged us to improve forecast accuracy.

The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. 
In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. 


## Datasets

calendar.csv - Contains information about the dates on which the products are sold.

sales_train_validation.csv - Contains the historical daily unit sales data per product and store [d_1 - d_1913]

sample_submission.csv - The correct format for submissions.

sell_prices.csv - Contains information about the price of the products sold per store and date.

sales_train_evaluation.csv - Includes sales [d_1 - d_1941] (labels used for the Public leaderboard)


## Evaluation

This competition uses a Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE). 

## My accomplishment

My team win the bronze metal, which is top 7% of the 5,558 teams.
Code files, my submission, and datasets are available to download.
